📌 What is BrainBin?

BrainBin is your personal idea vault — a lightning-fast notes app built for clean, minimal productivity.  
Whether it's your next big idea, class notes, or tasks to remember — BrainBin helps you organize everything without the mess.

❓ Why BrainBin?

Tired of scattered thoughts and cluttered dashboards?  
I built BrainBin to solve 3 common problems:
- ❌ Overwhelming UIs
- ❌ No drag and drop
- ❌ No visual structure of tasks

BrainBin solves this by combining:
- ✅ Simplicity
- ✅ Speed
- ✅ Structure

⚙️ How Does It Work?

- ✍ **Write** what matters — fast and clean
- 🧠 **Organize** by subjects, tags, and status
- 🔁 **Reorder** with drag & drop (powered by `@hello-pangea/dnd`)
- 🗑 **Delete** without regret (confirmation modal)
- 💡 **Add Resources** with links
- 🎯 **Track Progress** via To Do, In Progress, Done tabs
